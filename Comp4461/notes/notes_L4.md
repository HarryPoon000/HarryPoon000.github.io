# Understanding Humans - Memory
## Short-term vs. Long-term Memory


### Spread-Activation Theory
<p align="center">
  <img width="450" src="img/04/spread-activation.png">
</p>

**Priming**: Exposure to a stimulus influences behavior in subsequent, possibly unrelated tasks

### Hermann Ebbinghaus Law

- Serial Position Effect
  - Recall accuracy is a function of the position in the list
- Recency Effect
  - The latest item 
- Primacy Effect
  - The first few items

### Cliffhanger-Effect (Zeigarnik-Effect)
People remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed


### Self-Reference Effects
Things related to self are easier to remember (e.g. phone number, bdays)

## Spatial memory
Location, Orientation, Navigation

e.g. keyboards

people have a good idea of where their own bodies are

## Memory: Implications for HCI
- Practice and use in context help
  - Recall things “forgotten” due to decay & Interference 
  - Priming: spread-activation
- Make use of familiarity, habit, etc.
  - Enhance learnability


# Understanding Humans - Cognitive Systems

Human attention is dwindling
- this has to do with technology. Smarthphones tunes people to spend time in a fragmented manner

## Attention
### Nielsen’s Response Time Limits Law
- 0.1 seconds: feeling of instantaneous response
  - Good for direct manipulation
- 1 second: keeps the flow of thought seamless
  - OK for navigation
- 10 seconds: keeps the user’s attention, but – Often makes users leave immediately
- Have a sense of incapability
- Unpleasant


### Pareto Principle (80-20 Rule)

since our attention is so short, we will move on very quicky.

20% of the information given will be used to perceve 80% of people's understanding

### Attentional/situational blindness

> "Inability to see something that that is visibly there"

> "It is easy to miss something we are not looking for"

### Banner Blindness

people learn to ignore things like ADs by learning where they commonly are 

## Learning
- two types: 
  - Procedural (how to do something)
  - Declarative (facts about sth)
- Facilitated by
  - Analogy
  - Structure & organization 
  - incremental units
  - Repetition
- Hindered by
  - Previous knowledge (move from Mac to Windows)
  - Personal belief

### Learning on Technology Acceptation: Baby Duck Syndrome
tendency of a user to compate each new computer system to what they originally learned
> not-familiar -> negative

A baby who learned to use tablets was confused by a magazine

### Technology-Mediated Learning: Passive Learning
Poeple may learn without actively learning 

e.g. via haptics ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5L8KDfNENo))


## Problem Solving
- Deductive
  - If A, then B
  - “Select before copy” – provide hints
- Inductive
  - Generalizing from previous cases, knowledge transfer
  - “Also select before cut” – put similar things together
- Abductive
  - Reasons from a fact to the causal action or state
  - “grey out paste” – direct interpretation

### Hick-Hyman’s Law
- The more options, the harder (longer time) to decide
  <p align="center">
    <img width="500" src="img/04/hicks-law.png">
  </p>
- A default option has a higher likelihood to be chosen

### Problem Solving: Implications for HCI

People: 
- More Heuristics than algorithmic
- Choose suboptimal strategy for low priority task
- Learn better strategies through practices

Implications
- Use common template 
- Provide clear cues (e.g. changing mouse pointer)
- Follow consistent path

## Language
(Natural) Language
- The method of human communication, either spoken or written (or manual / signed), consisting of the use of words in a structured and conventional way

Language ability is acquired. The usage is situational

### Four Design Characteristics of Language

1. Language should be clear
   - Clarity is a consistent “one-to-one mapping between underlying semantic structures and surface forms,” but all natural languages have inconsistencies.
      - Lexical ambiguity (same word, diff meaning)
      - syntatic ambuiguity (same sentence/phrase, different meaning)
2. Language should be quick and easy
   - Language is often simplified through abbreviation or other shortening, obtaining efficiency at the expense of learnability, regularity or even clarity
3. Language should be expressive
   - > ... to communicate effectively, engagingly, appropriately ... to direct the listener’s attention
   - The diversity of language has decreased, which may be due to the use of internet slang
4. Language should be processible
   - The rate at which the speaker and listener can accurately encode and decode language utterances must be comparable
     - People may have different pronounciations 
   - If they proceeded at rates that were too discrepant or led to too much error, communication would suffer
     - Aphasia: language impairment caused by brain injuries

## Emotion
Helps modulate a lot of our other functions

> [!note] See Lecture notes for models of emotions


- **James-Lange Theory of Emotion**
  - Physiological theories suggest that responses within the body are responsible for emotions.
- **Schachter-Singer (Two Factor) Theory of Emotion**
  - Cognitive theories argue that thoughts and other mental activity play an essential role in forming emotions.
- **Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion**
  - Neurological theories propose that activity within the brain leads to emotional responses.
